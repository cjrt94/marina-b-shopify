With over 20 natural shades, it brings versatility and timeless beauty to any garment.</p><p>Sustainably sourced from high-altitude alpacas, this fiber is gently sheared without harm, supporting local communities and centuries-old Andean traditions. Every piece crafted with alpaca fiber reflects authenticity, sophistication, and a deep respect for the environment — a refined choice for those who value both comfort and conscious luxury.</p><p>There are two main types of alpacas: Huacaya and Suri. Huacaya alpacas make up approximately 85% of the total population. After shearing, local women carefully examine the fleece and classify it into different categories based on fiber fineness. This process yields several distinct types of fiber, including: Baby alpaca, Royal alpaca<br/>and Baby Suri alpaca</p>",
